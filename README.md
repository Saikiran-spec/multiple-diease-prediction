# multiple-diease-prediction
The multiple disease prediction model leverages natural language processing (NLP) and web-based deep learning (DL) techniques to analyze user-input symptoms and predict possible disease outcomes. The application is built using a combination of HTML, JavaScript, Python, and the Django framework, providing an interactive web interface for users to input symptoms. The backend processes these inputs, utilizing trained models to deliver accurate predictions, while ensuring a seamless user experience with an intuitive design and efficient data handling. Additionally, the system is designed to learn from user feedback to improve prediction accuracy over time.
